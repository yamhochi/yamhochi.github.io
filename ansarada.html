              a smarter feel and integrate new functions. I worked on several new features that spearheaded this
              refresh.</p>

                    <p>‘Insights Email’ was a weekly email that was sent to our users to inform their stakeholders’
                      engagement
                      by tracking their activity on our platform. While the product was successful, the data science
                      team
                      have produced a single universal metric — called the “Bidder Health Check” . The score improves
                      users’
                      experience by helping them gain insights without having to plough through multiple report cards
                      though
                      an email. This was the first time the company was integrating machine learning results into its
                      product
                      and our CEO was keen to release this as part of our rebranding strategy. This required a new set
                      of
                      designs that reflected this thinking as well as taking into account where we were heading in
                      terms
                      of visual branding. I was product designer of the team who brought this experience to life.

                    <p>The existing design language had a distinct look and layout rules. This was great for assembling
                      simple
                      pages rapidly but presented many constraints for richer data and visualisation displays.</p>

                    <p>Even though the new brand was not fully formed yet, I decided to try out my designs using the
                      new
                      brand
                      to see if it helps resolve the constraints I was facing in terms of layout and overall visual
                      harmony.
                      The new brand uses a completely new set of font – Lexia /Aktiv Grotesk that is tighter reflects a
                      different
                      mood. </p>

                    </div>
                    <p>I spent some time applying the new design principles onto some of our current products to
                      understand
                      how we could transform into the new framework but still maintaining overall coherence. From these
                      experiments,
                      I picked out a few key principles and styles and presented them back to the design team. Once we
                      were
                      happy with these upgrades, I carried on with my task, which is to come up with the new insights
                      email
                      design which is now known as the “Bidder Engagement Score”.

                    <h5>Redesigning legacy components</h5>
                    <p>Apart from how things look, I recommended a redesigning a few design components as they were no
                      longer
                      fit for our purpose. I made sure I built a clear case on how these new components should be used
                      clearly
                      communicated them with our lead interface architect.

                      logical
                      layout. The challenge with laying out a chart for the viewer is being able to highlight key
                      metrics
                      while keeping the x and y axis tickmarks visible. A lot of thinking went behind finding the right
                      interval for the tickmarks as the accounted period increased, without breaking our grid system.

                      a glance.
                      Even though predictive results may not be 100% accurate, I tried my best to ensure our message
                      was
                      reflected clearly in the design.</p>

                    <p>The key thing was to help our viewers understand why the predictions turn out the way they were.
                      And
                      more importantly, making sure there are enough visual cues to help viewers confirm their gut feel
                      about
                      an outcome.
                    </p>

                    <p>The hero chart was the single element that told the bulk of the story. The daily breakdown gives
                      the
                      viewer mental checkpoints whether certain events should have happened. </p>

                    <p>And if something didn’t align with their assumption, the “positive and negative” drivers were
                      supposed
                      to further support those predictions. Using the right terminology for these predictors was
                      something
                      I advocated for since the beginning. Having worked on and with many analytical stakeholders in
                      the
                      past, it was vivid to me that explaining the “why” behind the number is just as, if not more
                      important
                      than the “what”. </p>

                    <p>In this example, it was critical that we distinguished these factors as events that drove the
                      predictive
                      score “positively” or “negatively”. The initial iteration uses
                      an
                      “up” and “down” arrow without clear messaging and many people thought it was simply saying that
                      these
                      activities have decreased in volume, which is not the case.
                    </p>
                    <p>By changing it to a "positive(+)" and "negative(-)" sign, people were less likely to misunderstand the intent behind
                      it and were more open to the fact they were drivers rather than results.
