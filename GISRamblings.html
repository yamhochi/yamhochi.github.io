<!-- <h2>Randomised departure times</h2> -->

<h2>Where are we now and where are we heading to?</h2>

<p><img alt="Instagram Beach" src="https://igcdn-photos-h-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-xfa1/t51.2885-15/e15/11193202_1620183898198703_679950682_n.jpg" /></p>

<p>Spatial information is everywhere in a practice like city planning and urban economics, and spatial data helps to support decision making related to these activities.</p> 

<p>Geographic Information Systems (GIS) is an important data management tool that allows large amounts of complex information to be shown in snapshots of time and space, and allows decision making to be more transparent and effective. Both time and location can be processed using these tools.
</p>

<h2>Use of geographical information systems </h2>

<p>As a practitioner in this field, we use GIS to observe the flow of goods and people movements to answer questions about city services and where they are best to be provided. More broadly, it is used as a data analysis tool, as it can provide instantaneous feedback about selected decisions and it allows for the interaction with information. In addition, GIS provides the opportunity to predict future decision making possibilities as well as providing alternate scenarios and possible choices.</p>

<p>Through the investigation of different alternatives, users may visually realize how choices relate to outcomes. Because of that, GIS is deeply integrated into most planning practices that it has become an essential tool in the process of decision-making where both short and long term decision support is needed.</p>

<p>GIS is fundamentally different from most of the industries it relates to. We have seen organizations having difficulties integrating spatial intelligence into their business because of the lack of knowledge in the technical requirements and sizeable investments that come with it. For example, in planning, decisions are primarily based on acumen in planning principles and analytical abilities while GIS services are provided on the basis of data and computer science that sometimes include statistical and modeling knowledge.</p>

<p>For two fields that are so different to come together so seamlessly, the collaborative effort and foundations in knowledge sharing are important in order for GIS to function optimally in these situations.</p>

<h2>Working together</h2>

<p>Not all components of spatial analytics work seamlessly by default. Governments hold the key to vast amounts of information and raw data but are usually short of resources to put this information to good use. Industry users are constantly discovering new ways to extract, overlay and generate spatial intelligence however companies lack skills or knowledge in how to retain, recycle or feedback these information to the custodians or the broader system.</p>

<p>Software providers are caught up in the technology of the product that sometimes they forget users simply need a good experience and a workflow that can help them show spatial information effectively and clearly.</p>

<p>As a whole, the continuity in data provision and compatibility in technology systems are fundamental to the viability of the industry and ensure that GIS can continue to contribute to economic productivity.</p>


<h2>Opening doors of opportunity </h2>

<p>Social media and technology companies are unsurprisingly smart about the way they capture, retain and redistributed spatial data. For example, Walk Score website that promotes walkable neighbourhoods allows real estate agents to leverage their businesses by providing intelligence about health and active transport options.</p> 

<p>This was initially used to attract more visitors to the website but in the end attracted more attention on how actions can be taken to make neighbourhoods healthier and a better place to live.</p>

<p>Some local governments and state departments have started using geo-tagged photos and feeds to gauge citizen perception and satisfaction. But the science behind the data means there is a lot more to it and can be more than just a citizen engagement tool.</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>GIS help people from different backgrounds with various skills, enabling them to work more closely together to unlock insights on a subject. Users in different sectors should work together to harness the power of spatial information and encourage practitioners in different industries to continuously collaborate and share knowledge. This will ensure that business and industry are challenged, innovative and creative so they continue to provide intelligence on how to make our cities a better place to live in.</p>
